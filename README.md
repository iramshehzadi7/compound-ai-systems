Summarize the following in your own words, A single paragraph would be enough:
What are Compound AI Systems?
What are AI Agents?
What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?
What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?

COMPOUND AI SYSTEMS,AI AGENTS,FINE tuning

Compound AI Systems are advanced frameworks that combine multiple interacting compounds such as models,retrivers and external tools to handle difficult works more effectively than single models.
. AI Agents are autonomous entities that perform spesific works using AI techniques,often withen a larger system.
. The relationship between Compound AI System and AI Agents lies in their colaborative nature,AI Agents can be components withen compound AI systems working together to achieve a common goal.

. Fine-tuning involves adjusting a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on related tasks, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines a model with a retrieval system to enhance its responses by incorporating external information1.
